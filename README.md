DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK: PERSONAL-PORTFOLIO-WEBPAGE

This project is a **personal developer portfolio website** created using **HTML and CSS**, designed to showcase the skills, projects, and contact information of the developer, *Harini Saravanan*. It serves as an online presence that highlights Harini's expertise in web development and provides a structured and visually appealing layout.

1. **HTML Structure**

The HTML code is divided into several key sections:

- **Navigation Bar (`<nav>`)**: Provides easy access to different sections of the page — About, Projects, and Contact. The navigation links smoothly scroll to the respective sections using anchor tags.

- **About Section**: Introduces Harini as a passionate web developer, highlighting her interest in front-end development and technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also mentions one of her notable projects — a photo storage app with image classification.

- **Projects Section**: Contains two project placeholders. Each project has a heading and an editable `<textarea>` for entering descriptions. This section is styled for clarity and focus, making it easy to read and modify.

- **Contact Section**: Includes a contact form with fields for name, email, and message, allowing potential collaborators or employers to get in touch. The form is user-friendly with proper styling for accessibility.

- **Footer**: A simple copyright notice.

2. **CSS Styling**

The CSS complements the HTML with a dark theme and modern design choices:

- **Global Styles**: Sets a black background and white text to ensure readability. The `Poppins` font gives a clean, professional look.

- **Navigation Bar**: Styled with a dark gray background and white links that are neatly spaced.

- **Sections**: Have generous padding and are center-aligned for a clean layout. The Projects section uses white boxes with a subtle shadow to create contrast against the dark background.

- **Project Descriptions**: Styled with a light theme inside the dark background for better focus and readability. The `textarea` is resizable and includes spacing and borders for user convenience.

- **Contact Form**: Uses a vertical layout with dark-styled input fields and a consistent look with the rest of the site.

- **Buttons and Footer**: Buttons change color on hover to indicate interactivity, and the footer is consistent with the overall dark theme.

Summary

This portfolio website is a great example of how to present personal information and projects in a clean, responsive, and visually appealing manner. It combines basic web development skills with thoughtful design to create a professional online resume.
